Golfapedia is an application that renders local golf courses and weather for a city of the user's choice, while allowing them to create a customized list of saved courses that persists in local storage.
The user simply types a valid city name into the search input, submits the request, and the page will render the current weather in that city and a list of nearby courses, including their address and rating. Each course listing also features a save button which the user can click to add it to their saved courses list that will still display when the page is refreshed.
